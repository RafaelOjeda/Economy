    <div style="text-indent:35px">The Psuedo Code folder is meant to be used like scratch paper.</div> 
It contains many different .TXT files that are broken down into small sections like classes or methods.
No code necessary just enough for an idea to be understood and possibly integrated into the project.
Good practice would be for all the things in the TODO list to move its way in the Psuedo Code folder then implemented.

<ul>
    <h6>TODO:</h6>
    <li>Make it so all information is kept in a .TXT file.</li>
    <li>Implement a way for all information to be added using the Command Prompt.</li>
    <li>Create a Credit Score System</li>
    <li>Include interests on loans based on Credit Score and other variables.</li>
    <li>Make the code as clean as possible by adding methods and making it all readable.</li>
</ul>
